"Fifteen Puzzle"


This is a GUI version of the Fifteen Puzzle Game. The game starts off in the solved position, and lets the user shuffle the board for a random solvable puzzle. The user can click on numbers next to an empty spot to move that number into the empty slot. The goal of the game is to put the puzzle back into the solved position (all numbers in a row). The user has the option to solve the puzzle using the menu option. Note: Solving the puzzle might take a long time/crash the program(run out of memory) as the algorithm used isn't very efficient. 


To run this program on command line:
